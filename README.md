===============

This sample shows how to connect a Sparkfun IOIO board to an EasyDriver board.

This example is ported from Dan Thompson's blog, and modified to be run on the IOIO board using an Android application project for Eclipse.

See [com.ioioapp.ioioeasydriver.MainActivity](https://github.com/aalbino/ioio-easydriver/blob/master/IOIOEasyDriver/src/com/ioioapp/ioioeasydriver/MainActivity.java) for more info.
